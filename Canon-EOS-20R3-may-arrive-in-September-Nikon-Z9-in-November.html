<p>Though the final date hasn't been revealed, Canon will definitely beat Nikon to the finishing line if the rumored date is exact.</p>
<p>With a Nikon executive's recent revelation, this seemingly is in line with a recent revelation that the team in development is additionally struggling to get the aim to bring the flagship feeling that users are hoping for.</p>
<p>According to a previous report from Nikon Rumors, the official launch will be only in November or December 2021.</p>
<p>It may be the great opportunity that during the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, at least the Canon EOS R3 will probably be in some sports journalists as a testing ground before any announcement came officially.
