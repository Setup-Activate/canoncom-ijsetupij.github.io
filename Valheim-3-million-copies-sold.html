<h1>Valheim's 3million copies sold being hottest PC-game</h1>
<p>Valheim is the new hottest PC game by Steam, where its Early Access sales charts show its 3 million sold copies. Polygon appeared to like its $20 Viking-themed survival game. Just 8 days after launch, on February 10th, indie developer Iron Gate reported that&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>had already sold its 1 million copies.

<h2>Something you should know about Valheim &ndash;</h2>
<ul>
<li>At one point of Steam, Valheim is the second most played PC game, ahead of each game save&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&nbsp;</em>that&rsquo;s sitting at number three at this point.</li>
<li>With roughly 392,000 concurrent players on Steam, it&rsquo;s already set a top-ten record.</li>
<li>With 410,000 players, it took the #9 spot by Friday that pulls down&nbsp;<em>Postal.</em></li>
<li>During Valve&rsquo;s Steam Lunar New Year sale, it topped the Steam Top Sellers list with zero discount</li>
</ul>
<p>The nearest equal is maybe PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds, which similarly emerged from Steam Early Access, sold tons of copies during Steam deals, and it set a record for the Steam game with the most concurrent players (3.2 million), actually standing today and commenced the whole battle royale genre that generated the present Call of Duty: Warzone, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and more. Even PUBG required a long time to arrive at the sort of numbers that Valheim already has now and was with nail-biting, action-packed, genre-defining, and streamer-friendly games to makes for a wonderfully tense watch.</p>
<p>At Polygon, Cass Marshal points out that it&rsquo;s additionally easy to learn and incredibly accessible. In&nbsp;<em>Valheim,&nbsp;</em>you don&rsquo;t require to spend so long time to create some basic tools, as well as no requirement to acquire blueprints. You can immediately crush a portion of a design and refund your materials if it&rsquo;s not exactly right.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say how long the magic will keep going after building temporary forward operating bases. There&rsquo;s also no nettling for the 2 million players and counting as well for lasted this. Though, we guess word-of-mouth may let&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>&nbsp;going for a while. It&rsquo;s been all declining for Among Us on PC, which at present only draws in one-10th of its peak player count of last September&rsquo;s 438,000.&nbsp;</p>
